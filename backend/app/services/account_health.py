"""Account health guard: one score per account + automatic parking.

Why this exists: failure signals are scattered (throttle cooldowns,
proxy streaks, challenge flags, trial 500s). This module folds them into
a single 0-100 score with a level + human reasons, and parks accounts
that fail repeatedly *for any reason* — not just the two kinds
execute_post already handles (challenge/throttled).

Design rules (anti-interference):
- Scoring core is pure (compute_health): no DB, fully unit-tested.
- Row aggregation is pure too (summarize_statuses), shared by the sync
  worker path and the async API path so the two can never drift apart.
- maybe_park_account_sync only mutates when status is "active" — it
  never fights an existing cooldown/challenge/ban, and it never commits
  (the caller owns the transaction).
- Parking reuses the existing cooldown machinery (status + 6h
  cooldown_until) so every existing reader (eligible_account, UI,
  realtime) behaves unchanged.
